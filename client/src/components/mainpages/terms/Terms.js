            <h2 className="title">TERMS OF SERVICE // FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)s</h2>

            <br />
            <h2>Thank you for your order! Please review the following information below carefully as when you buy from Minty, you agree to the following terms and conditions!</h2>
            <br />
            <br />

            <h2>What is the estimated processing time for my order?</h2>
            <p>- Normally, Minty completes orders within 1-2 weeks of receiving a completed order! </p>
            <br />

            <h2>What is the typical estimated shipping time? </h2>
            <p>- This depends on where you live! Minty resides in California, and orders made to North America are estimated to arrive within 3-5 business days after an order is processed and shipped by Minty. International orders may take from 2-7 weeks to arrive depending on location and customs processing!</p>
            <p>- To prevent delay of your order, please make sure your address is a working one! Without a working address, your goods are not guaranteed to arrive! You can verify your address using services such as Google Maps. Minty will send out at least two emails to attempt and clarify an address before cancelling your order and issuing a refund. </p>
            <p>- If an order is returned to Minty, the buyer will be notified and given the option for having the parcel being shipped out again for an additional shipping fee to ship out the parcel once again. Should the buyer disagree to paying an additional shipping fee to ship out the parcel, the buyer is eligible to a refund of the items in the purchase but NOT the shipping fee originally paid for the items. </p>
            <br />

            <h2>What about customs and import taxes? </h2>
            <p>- Buyers are responsible for any customs and import taxes that apply as per arriving country's laws and regulations! Minty is not responsible for delays caused by customs and is not responsible fore reimbursing any orders' potential duty fees. </p>
            <br />

            <h2>Will my order come with tracking?</h2>
            <p>- Yes, tracking numbers should be sent via email the day that the order is shipped! </p>
            <br />

            <h2>Returns/Exchanges/Cancellations?</h2>
            <p>- Minty does not accept any returns or cancellations. However, if there is a problem with your order, please contact Minty at merryminnt@gmail.com with your order number to resolve the order. </p>
            <br />

            <h2>Do you have any other storefronts?</h2>
